# Miralo - TV

A captivating app for movie enthusiasts created to hone my coding skills. I have utilized the TMDB API to develop an intuitive and engaging movie-watching experience. Inspired by HBO's design, I have meticulously crafted the app's interface to provide a seamless browsing and viewing experience. With Miralo - TV, users can explore a vast library of movies, read detailed descriptions and reviews to help make informed choices. The app is built using cutting-edge technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and has been optimized for superior performance on all devices. I am excited to showcase this project on GitHub and welcome feedback from fellow developers.
